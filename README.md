# Web Scraping Data Analytics Jobs

## Introduction

In this project, I will build a web scraper to extract job listings from a popular job search platform. 
I'll extract job titles, companies, locations, job descriptions, and other relevant information.

Here are the main steps I'll follow in this project:

1. Setup the development environment
2. Understand the basics of web scraping
3. Analyze the website structure of the job search platform
4. Write the Python code to extract job data from the job search platform
5. Save the data to a CSV file
6. Test the web scraper and refine the code as needed

## Packages

The work will be performed on Jupyter Notebooks, and I will be using the following packages in my Python environment:

- requests
- BeautifulSoup
- csv
- datetime
